# My Fitness App
**_Focused on weightlifting training_**



This is my first personal project, so I've decided to do it about something that I'm really passionte about: weight training!
Here I'm going to be adding my first ideas to lead my project and also the features that I've always wanted to have on a fitness app but that I've never quite found.

**Here we go!**

## Features

### Sessions' log
Create your own session using the exercises provided or craft your own.
Mark your session as completed. Once you've completed your session, edit it if you used a different weight, add the date and any comments about it (how it felt, any improvements or tips you want to have in mind about each exercise or the session in general).

### Weight log
Once you've marked your session as completed, we will automatically craft a weight log for every exercise you've performed so you can keep track of the weight you've used and its date.

### PR log
The same as the feature above, we will automatically store your Personal Records.

### Your progress
Craft your own progress.
Year goals.
Monthly goals

Enable or disable these features: 
- Upload progress pictures
- Upload your measurements

### Extras
* **Plates calc.** Choose the plates you have available, the weight of your bar and the weight you want to perform. We do the plate math for you.
* **Weight conversor.** Kg to pounds and viceversa.
